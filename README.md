# Game Graphics Programming Engine
This was created for IGME 540 Game Graphics Programming.
This project was specifically made for me to learn how DirectX 11 and HLSL. This project was created using my professors starter code which mainly created the window and enabled DirectX 11. Outside of that, the skybox, textures, 3d objects, lighting - everything was created by me using C++ or HLSL.

The starter code was created by Chris Cascioli

This code also utilizes Simple Shader to load the various vertex and pixel shaders find that here https://github.com/vixorien/SimpleShader
